# LinkedIn Profile Connection System

This project is a Java-based simulation of a LinkedIn-like profile connection system. Users can create profiles, send and manage connection requests, and view their connections. It employs fundamental data structures like linked lists, arrays, and hash maps for efficient management of profiles and relationships.

## Features

1. **Add Profile**  
   Users can create their profiles by providing a unique ID and name.

2. **View Profiles**  
   Display all the existing profiles in the system.

3. **Send Connection Requests**  
   Users can send connection requests to other profiles by providing the recipient's ID.

4. **Manage Connection Requests**  
   Users can view and accept/reject pending connection requests.

5. **View Connections**  
   Display the list of all accepted connections for a user.

6. **Close System**  
   Exit the system gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core language for implementing the system.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes linked lists for profile management and hash maps for quick lookups of user information.
- **Scanner API**: For user input.
